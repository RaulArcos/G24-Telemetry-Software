# G24 Telemetry Software
This is the telemetry code for the 2024 University of CÃ¡diz Formula Student Car that participated both in FSAustria and FSSpain.
It consist of a simple implementation using  a ESP32 with a LTE SIM Module integrated (T-SIM7600E/G-H), which takes data from diferent sensors, including using CAN Bus for taking in engine data from the Link G4+ ECU.

For sending the data outside, it uses MQTT to send messages to a NodeRED service that came handy to implement an easy and scalable web interface that able this project to watch live telemetry.
